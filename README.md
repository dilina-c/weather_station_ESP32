# weather_station_ESP32
The weather station using ESP32 and DHT11 is a device that is designed to measure and collect data on various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The ESP32 component is responsible for collecting the data from the DHT11 sensor and uploading it to the internet through a WiFi connection. The data is then uploaded to a Google Sheets document, where it can be accessed and analyzed by the user.

The weather station is easy to set up and use, requiring only a WiFi connection and access to a Google Sheets account. The device can be placed in a desired location and left to run continuously, providing real-time data on weather conditions in that location. The collected data can be used for a variety of purposes, such as tracking weather patterns for agricultural or meteorological purposes, or simply monitoring the weather in a specific location for personal use.

Overall, the weather station using ESP32 and DHT11 is a reliable and convenient tool for collecting and analyzing weather data. Its simple setup and use make it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.
